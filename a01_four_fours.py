# Computes the integers 0 through 4 using exactly 4 fours, and a 
# creative combination of arithmetic operators.


# this statement creates a variable called 'zero' which is the result of the expression 4 + 4 - 4 - 4
zero = 4 + 4 - 4 - 4

# continue to create variables 'one', 'two', 'three', and 'four' below.
"""

zero = 4 + 4 - 4 - 4

one = (4 ** 4) / (4 ** 4)

two = (4 * 4) / (4 + 4)

three = (4 + 4 + 4) / 4

four = (4 * (4 - 4)) + 4
